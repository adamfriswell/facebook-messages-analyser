# facebook-messages-analyser
Console App to analyse Facebook messages

## Motivation:
I discovered that Facebook allows you to [download all of the information they hold about you](https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav).
Included in this is all of the messages you have ever sent, which can be downloaded in Json format.
I was interested to getting some stats on some of my group chats which have been running for years, eg. total number of messages sent in the group and by each participant.
